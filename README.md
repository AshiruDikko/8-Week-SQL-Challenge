## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

The full case study can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/ "Danny's Diner") and my solution [here](https://github.com/AshiruDikko/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/master/Case%20Study%20%231%20-%20Danny's%20Diner/Solution.md).
